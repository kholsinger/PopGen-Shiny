This repository contains some simple [R
Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) applications that I developed to
illustrate topics I cover in my graduate course on [Population
Genetics](http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/uncommon-ground/eeb348/). Each
of the applications is hosted at shinyapps.io. You'll find them
embedded in the detail pages for various lectures on my course
website. Below you'll find a list of direct links to make access a bit
more convenient.
